    <h2>Some bits & bobs</h2>
    Here lives some miscellaneous things I reference one or one hundred
    times and figure they should be gathered somewhere.
    <h3>wpa_supplicant</h3>
    Frequently forgotten usage of the <code>wpa_cli</code> tool
    <pre>
> scan
...
<3>CTRL-EVENT-SCAN-RESULTS
> scan_results # run once above event appears
bssid / freq / sig lvl / flags / ssid
...
> add_network
#
> set_network # ssid "network"
> set_network # psk "psswd"
# or if no password:

    <h3>GPG key signing with Git</h3>
    Sometime ago I spent hours on a new system on this. When signing a
    commit, this error would appear
    <pre>
gpg: skipped "Foo Bar <Foo_Bar@baz>": No secret key[GNUPG:] INV_SGNR 9 Foo Bar <Foo_Bar@baz>[GNUPG:] FAILURE sign 17
gpg: signing failed: No secret key
    </pre>
    After much searching I came up empty handed. Finally, one thing
    stood out. The name and email in <code>~/.gitconfig</code> must
    match exactly to the name and email associated with the GPG key
    <pre>
$ gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long
/home/foo/.gnupg/pubring.kbx

$ head -n 4 .gitconfig
[user]
	name = Foo Bar
	email = Foo_Bar@baz
	signingkey = FC53C827D09C7050
    </pre>
    <h3>SSH agent for password-less login</h3>
    I have four machines I frequently log in to and from via SSH. Typing
    in a password every time is tiresome and a password-less key is not
    an option. A solution is an SSH agent running in the background, which
    prompts for a password once at log in, and stores it for the duration
    of the session (until reboot). The following can live in your shell's
    startup file (eg. <code>~/.zshrc</code>)
    <pre>
if [ ! -S ~/.ssh/ssh_auth_sock ]; then
  eval "$(ssh-agent)"
  ln -sf "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ~/.ssh/ssh_auth_sock
fi
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=~/.ssh/ssh_auth_sock
ssh-add -l > /dev/null || ssh-add
    </pre>
    Then, just copy the needed key between machines with <code>ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_xxx.pub name@host</code>
    <h3>Configuration file manager</h3>
    Across the aforementioned four machines, I also have various configuration
    files (dotfiles) that I like to keep track of for the sake of backing
    them up incase of data loss. I use <a href="https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm" target="_blank">yadm</a>
    to achieve this. Mostly for it's ease of use (yadm is quite simply
    an alias for git) and minimal system footprint, which consists mostly
    of a git directory living out of sight in <code>~/.local/share/yadm/repo.git</code>.
    Since it's just Git under the hood, a standard <code>.gitignore</code>
    file can be used to ignore which ever files you choose in your home directory.
    By default, yadm only manages files within your home directory. While not
    conventional, it can also be used to track system-level files by creating
    an alias like <code>sysyadm="sudo yadm --yadm-dir /etc/yadm --yadm-data /etc/yadm/data"</code>,
    then used like normal.
    <pre>
# sysyadm init -w /
# sysyadm add foo.conf
# sysyadm commit -m "foo"
    </pre>
  </body>
