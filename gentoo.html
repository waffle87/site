    <h2>Gentoo Linux on Macbook Air</h2>
    This page covers various features, nuances, notes, etc. of my
    Gentoo system running on a 2012 Macbook Air. This laptop was
    initially bought as a tinkering project for $150USD. While this
    is not the most powerful device, it is suitable for all the work
    I encounter on a daily basis and is used as my primary system. My
    intentions for this system are reliability and speed above all.
    With this comes a minimal OS with very few kernel parameters
    set, extremely fine-tuned USE flags, and a usable system that I
    am extremely familiar with. All my configuration can be found on
    my <a href="https://github.com/waffle87/dots/tree/xena"> github</a>.

      <h3>Kernel</h3>
      After spending many hours narrowing down kernel options enabled,
      I have a 7.8 MB kernel image with ~4000 parameters set. Note,
      this configuration is very hardware and user specific. I opted
      for absolutely zero modules since I don't need any out-of-tree
      hardware support. I also did not configure anything very drastically
      in either direction, like extreme security, sacraficing usability, etc.
      I chose to use <a href="https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-kernel/gentoo-sources">gentoo-sources</a>
      to provide kernel source as it contains some handy patches and is easy
      to obtain via emerge. A base 6.7 kernel builds locally (remember, 4 
      cores) in approximately 17 minutes, which is not too much of a pain
      when troubleshooting on bare metal. I also chose to omit an initramfs,
      which means CPU microcode can/should be built directly into the kernel.
      This can be achieved by first installing <code>sys-firmware/intel-microcode</code>.
      This is also a good time to add microcode signature to <code>/etc/portage/make.conf</code>
      <pre>
$ iucode_tool -S -l /lib/firmware/intel-ucode/*
iucode_tool: system has processor(s) with signature 0x000306a9
microcode bundle 1: /lib/firmware/intel-ucode/06-3a-09
selected microcodes:
  001/001: sig 0x000306a9, pf_mask 0x12, 2019-02-13, rev 0x0021, size 14336
# echo 'MICROCODE_SIGNATURES="-s 0x000306a9"' >> /etc/portage/make.conf
      </pre>
      CPU's signature is found in bundle 1, so the filename to use is <code>/lib/firmware/intel-ucode/06-3a-09</code>.
      Ensure the following kernel options are set approximately, where the argument
      passed to <code>CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE</code> is the filename of our microcode
      <pre>
CONFIG_MICROCODE=y
CONFIG_FW_LOADER=y
CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE="intel-ucode/06-3a-09"
CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE_DIR="/lib/firmware"
      </pre>
      Check dmesg for microcode output to ensure all was successful. For
      some more kernel configuration stuff, see <a href="kernel.html">here</a>.
    </div>
    <div id="bootloader">
      <h3>Bootloader</h3>
      Spoiler: there is none. For the duration of my time using Linux, I have used GRUB as my
      bootloader across various systems. In my experience, it's been
      ok, it does what it needs to, allows for extensive configuration
      like theming and requiring a password. However, some time ago it
      went kaput and despite manually setting the root partition in
      <code>/boot/grub/grub.cfg</code>, it seems the incorrect value
      was passed to the kernel at boot and the partition could not be found.
      Every time I would reboot I would have to manually set it (which
      is a handy trick to know nonetheless)
      <pre>
grub> ls
(hd0) (hd0,gpt0) (hd0,gpt1) (hd0,gpt2)
grub> ls (hd0,gpt1)/
vmlinuz vmlinuz.old
grub> root=(hd0,gpt1)
grub> linux /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/sda3
grub> boot
      </pre>
      Since this isn't a multiboot machine or anything, I can simply omit
      GRUB and expose the kernel image as an EFI stub. First, the
      following kernel options must be set
      <pre>
CONFIG_EFI=y
CONFIG_EFI_STUB=y
CONFIG_CMDLINE_BOOL=y
CONFIG_CMDLINE="root=PARTUUID=... ro"
      </pre>
      The root must be set to the <code>PARTUUID</code> value
      of the root partition. Use <code>blkid</code> to obtain this
      Once kernel has been recompiled, copy the image to the EFI partition
      and create a new boot entry. It is also wise to remove unneeded entries
      to conserve space
      <pre>
# efibootmgr -b 1 -B
# cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage /boot/efi/gentoo/bzImage-x.y.z.efi
# efibootmgr -c -d /dev/sda -L "gentoo efi stub" -l "\efi\gentoo\bzImage-x.y.z.efi"
      </pre>
      Reboot and the bootable system should be shown in Mac's EFI program
    </div>
    <div id="portage">
      <h3>Portage</h3>
      <h4>Profile</h4>
      When initially setting this up, I opted for a multilib system as
      I was still using some 32-bit programs at the time. Since, I have
      switched to a no-multilib profile. Unlike adding multilib support
      to a 64-bit only system, going from multilib to no-multilib is
      quite easy.
      <pre>
# eselect profile list
  ...
  [12]  default/linux/amd64/17.1/no-multilib (stable)
  ...
# eselect profile set 12
# emerge -auDN @world
# emerge --depclean
      </pre>
      It was pleasant to see 60+ packages removed after the switch. And
      have much reduced overhead in my system overall.
      <h4>Compiler</h4>
      As Clang/LLVM has become more and more stable and is able to compile all
      packages installed, I chose to switch the default compiler, linker
      and other bits over from GCC. This is easy enough in <code>/etc/portage/make.conf</code>.
      <pre>
CC="clang"
CXX="clang++"
AR="llvm-ar"
NM="llvm-nm"
RANLIB="llvm-ranlib"
      </pre>
      If needed, a GCC fallback environment can be made containing the
      previous variables, then applied to certain packages which may fail
      under Clang via adding an entry in <code>/etc/portage/package.env</code>.
      Some advantagees of using Clang over GCC are slightly faster compilation
      times and reduced memory usage, and potentially safer binaries overall.
      <h4>USE Flags</h4>
      My USE flags and related options are quite minimal. Global flags include
      <pre>
USE="alsa bluetooth clang dbus elogind gles2 jpeg png \
     pulseaudio sdl udev wayland X -systemd -vulkan -nls"
ACCEPT_LICENSE="*"
ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~amd64"
      </pre>
      For reference, some primary features used on this system are
      Wayland, Pipewire, elogind, and OpenRC. Since no-multilib already
      has very few things enabled, not many flags needed to be disabled.
