    <h2>Some bits & bobs</h2>
    Here lives some miscellaneous things I reference one or one hundred
    times and figure they should be gathered somewhere.
    <h3>wpa_supplicant</h3>
    Frequently forgotten usage of the <code>wpa_cli</code> tool

    <h3>GPG key signing with Git</h3>
    Sometime ago I spent hours on a new system on this. When signing a
    commit, this error would appear
    <pre>
gpg: skipped "Foo Bar <Foo_Bar@baz>": No secret key[GNUPG:] INV_SGNR 9 Foo Bar <Foo_Bar@baz>[GNUPG:] FAILURE sign 17
gpg: signing failed: No secret key
    </pre>
    After much searching I came up empty handed. Finally, one thing
    stood out. The name and email in <code>~/.gitconfig</code> must
    match exactly to the name and email associated with the GPG key
    <pre>
$ gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long
/home/foo/.gnupg/pubring.kbx

$ head -n 4 .gitconfig
[user]
	name = Foo Bar
	email = Foo_Bar@baz
	signingkey = FC53C827D09C7050
    </pre>
    <h3>SSH agent for password-less login</h3>
    I have four machines I frequently log in to and from via SSH. Typing
    in a password every time is tiresome and a password-less key is not
    an option. A solution is an SSH agent running in the background, which
    prompts for a password once at log in, and stores it for the duration
    of the session (until reboot). The following can live in your shell's
    startup file (eg. <code>~/.zshrc</code>)
    <pre>
if [ ! -S ~/.ssh/ssh_auth_sock ]; then
  eval "$(ssh-agent)"
  ln -sf "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ~/.ssh/ssh_auth_sock
fi
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=~/.ssh/ssh_auth_sock
ssh-add -l > /dev/null || ssh-add
    </pre>
    Then, just copy the needed key between machines with <code>ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_xxx.pub name@host</code>
    <h3>Configuration file manager</h3>
    Across the aforementioned four machines, I also have various configuration
    files (dotfiles) that I like to keep track of for the sake of backing
    them up incase of data loss. I use <a href="https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm" target="_blank">yadm</a>
    to achieve this. Mostly for it's ease of use (yadm is quite simply
    an alias for git) and minimal system footprint, which consists mostly
    of a git directory living out of sight in <code>~/.local/share/yadm/repo.git</code>.
    Since it's just Git under the hood, a standard <code>.gitignore</code>
    file can be used to ignore which ever files you choose in your home directory.
    By default, yadm only manages files within your home directory. While not
    conventional, it can also be used to track system-level files by creating
    an alias like <code>sysyadm="sudo yadm --yadm-dir /etc/yadm --yadm-data /etc/yadm/data"</code>,
    then used like normal.
    <pre>
# sysyadm init -w /
# sysyadm add foo.conf
# sysyadm commit -m "foo"
    </pre>
    <h3>Hardware security key for authentication on Linux</h3>
    Typing in a rather long password each time I log into my computer
    or need to complete a privileged task can be bothersome. A couple
    years ago I came across <a href="https://github.com/solokeys" target="_blank">solokeys</a>,
    which are fully open source hardware and firmware security keys. I
    chose to build the <a href="https://github.com/solokeys/solo-hw" target="_blank">Solo 1</a>
    (or five because that's the MOQ from most PCB manufacturers). Note,
    at the time of writing this, the <a href="https://github.com/solokeys/solo1-cli" target="_blank">solo1-cli</a>
    tool is currently broken with the latest FIDO2 library, meaning
    it must be installed explicitly at 0.9.3.
    <pre>
$ pip3 install solo1
$ pip3 install fido2==0.9.3
    </pre>
    After building, I didn't use it much, as many services don't support
    security keys quite yet, or required a paid subscription (I'm looking
    at you, Bitwarden). Come a few months ago, I found <a href="https://github.com/Yubico/pam-u2f" target="_blank">Yubico's PAM for U2F</a>.
    To use this, first ensure the <code>CONFIG_HIDRAW</code> and
    <code>CONFIG_USB_HIDDEV</code> options are set in your kernel.
    Next, obtain the module via package manager or compiling from source
    and generate the authorisation mapping with your key inserted. The
    created directory must be named <code>Yubico</code>, even if not
    using a Yubico key. It can be overridden in <a href="https://github.com/Yubico/pam-u2f/blob/main/util.h#L14" target="_blank">util.h</a>
    if you so choose.
    <pre>
$ mkdir ~/.config/Yubico
$ pamu2fcfg > ~/.config/Yubico/u2f_keys
Enter PIN for /dev/hidraw2:
    </pre>
    Assuming all has been successful, you can configure PAM services
    to use the device. The following configures doas to utilise the
    U2F module in the <code>/etc/pam.d/doas</code> file. The same line
    can be added in other files where needed (eg. display manager,
    <code>system-local-login</code>, etc.)
    <pre>
auth sufficient pam_u2f.so cue pinverification=0
auth include system-auth
...
    </pre>
    Above, <b>sufficient</b> indicates that authentication from the device
    alone is enough to fully authenticate. Use <b>required</b> instead
    if you want both password and device authentication to be required.
    <b>cue</b> simply displays a prompt to press the button on the device
    when needed to authenticate. <b>pinverification=0</b> disables the need
    to entre the passphrase associated with your security key. Note, this
    means your system can be accessed only with your key, and no password entry
    of any type. Set the parameter to 1 if you'd like otherwise.
