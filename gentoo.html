    <h2>Gentoo Linux on Macbook Air</h2>
    This page covers various features, nuances, notes, etc. of my Gentoo system
    running on a 2012 Macbook Air. This laptop was initially bought as a
    tinkering project for 150USD. While this is not the most powerful device, it
    is suitable for just about anything I encounter on a daily basis and is used
    as my primary system. My intentions for this system are reliability and
    speed most importantly. Follows is a tidy system with minimal kernel
    parameters set, fine-tuned USE flags, and a system I'm rather familiar with.
    Much of my configuration can be found
    <a href="https://git.pngu.org/dots" target="_blank">here</a>. <br /><br />

      <h4>Modifications</h4>
      Since 2010, Apple Macbooks have used their proprietary SSDs with
      non-standard connectors. When I bought this machine, it came with a 128 GB
      Samgsung "blade" SSD which I was not very keen on keeping. Luckily, there
      exists
      <a
        href="https://www.microconnectors.com/macbook-m-2-nvme-upgrade-adapter/"
        target="_blank"
        >adapters</a
      >
      which simply act as a bridge between a standard M.2 SSD and Apple's
      connector. Installation was quite easy and the adapter has been reliable
      since. This laptop also came with what I presume was the original battery,
      as it lasted about 15 minutes after being charged and would lose power
      randomly. A suitable

      can be found roughly 50USD. With this, I get about 5 hours on a full
      charge, mostly thanks to
      <a href="https://github.com/linrunner/TLP" target="_blank">TLP</a> and
      thermald. Now, if only the memory wasn't soldered directly to the
      motherboard, or I could find the courage to

      >.

    <div id="kernel">
      <h3>Kernel</h3>
      After spending quite some time narrowing down kernel parameters enabled, I
      have a 7.8MB kernel image with ~4000 parameters set. Note, this
      configuration is very hardware and user specific. I opted for zero modules
      since I don't need any out-of-tree hardware support. I also did not
      configure anything very drastically in either direction, like extreme
      security, sacraficing usability, etc. I chose to use
      <a
        href="https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-kernel/gentoo-sources"
        target="_blank"
        >gentoo-sources</a
      >
      to provide kernel source as it contains some handy patches and is easy to
      obtain via <code>emerge</code>. A base 6.10 kernel builds locally (with 4
      cores!) in approximately 17 minutes, which is not too troublesome when
      working on bare metal. I also chose to omit an initramfs, which means CPU
      microcode can/should be built directly into the kernel. This can be
      achieved by first installing <code>sys-firmware/intel-microcode</code>.
      This is also a good time to add microcode signature to
      <code>/etc/portage/make.conf</code>:
      <pre>
$ iucode_tool -S -l /lib/firmware/intel-ucode/*
        iucode_tool: system has processor(s) with <b>signature 0x000306a9</b>
microcode bundle 1: /lib/firmware/intel-ucode/06-3a-09
selected microcodes:
  001/001: sig 0x000306a9, pf_mask 0x12, 2019-02-13, rev 0x0021, size 14336
# echo 'MICROCODE_SIGNATURES="-s 0x000306a9"' >> /etc/portage/make.conf
      </pre>
      CPU's signature is found in bundle 1, so the filename to use is
      <code>/lib/firmware/intel-ucode/06-3a-09</code>. Ensure the following
      kernel options are set appropriately, where the argument passed to
      <code>CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE</code> is the filename of our microcode
      <pre>
CONFIG_MICROCODE=y
CONFIG_FW_LOADER=y
CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE="intel-ucode/06-3a-09"
CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE_DIR="/lib/firmware"
      </pre>
      Check <code>dmesg</code> for microcode output to ensure all was
      successful. Specific configuration for this machine can be found at
      <a
        href="https://git.pngu.org/dots/tree/.config/kernel.config"
        target="_blank"
        >6.10.0 .config</a
      >. For some more kernel related stuff, see
      <a href="kernel.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </div>
    <div id="bootloader">
      <h3>Bootloader</h3>
      Spoiler: there is none. For the duration of my time using Linux, I have
      used GRUB across various systems. In my experience, it's been ok, it does
      what it needs to, allows for ample configuration like theming and
      security. However, some time ago it went kaput on this machine and despite
      manually setting the root partition in
      <code>/boot/grub/grub.cfg</code>, it seems the incorrect value was passed
      to the kernel at boot and the partition could not be found. Every time I
      would reboot I would have to manually set it from GRUB command line (which
      is a handy trick to know nonetheless):
      <pre>
grub> ls
(hd0) (hd0,gpt0) (hd0,gpt1) (hd0,gpt2)
grub> ls (hd0,gpt1)/
vmlinuz vmlinuz.old
grub> root=(hd0,gpt1)
grub> linux /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/sda3
grub> boot
      </pre>
      Since this isn't a multiboot machine, GRUB can simply be omitted and
      expose the kernel image as an EFI stub. First, the following kernel
      options must be set
      <pre>
CONFIG_EFI=y
CONFIG_EFI_STUB=y
CONFIG_CMDLINE_BOOL=y
CONFIG_CMDLINE="root=PARTUUID=&ltuuid&gt ro"
      </pre>
      Where root is set to the <code>PARTUUID</code> value of the root
      partition. Use <code>blkid</code> to obtain this. Once kernel has been
      recompiled, copy the image to the EFI partition and create a new boot
      entry with below command(s). It is also wise to remove unneeded entries to
      conserve limited space. (below command selects the first entry with
      <code>-b</code> and deletes it with <code>-B</code>)
      <pre>
# efibootmgr -b 1 -B
# cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage /boot/efi/gentoo/bzImage-x.y.z.efi
# efibootmgr -c -d /dev/sda -L "gentoo efi stub" -l "\efi\gentoo\bzImage-x.y.z.efi"
      </pre>
      Reboot and the bootable system should be shown in Mac's EFI program.
    </div>
    <div id="system_bits">
      <h3>Other System Bits</h3>
      <h4>C Library</h4>
      I opted to use <a href="https://musl.libc.org" target="_blank">musl</a> on
      this system, over the traditionally used glibc. While there are
      never-ending debates over which library is better, using musl has some
      clear benefits on this machine. Namely, shorter compile times -- musl
      compiles in roughly 2 minutes, versus glibc's 2 hours. Omitting glibc also
      removes the dependency for GCC, another hefty package. As for the reduced
      "compatibility" when using musl, in terms of non-POSIX compliant code,
      Flatpak is an adequate solution. I currently use Flatpak packages for
      proprietary applications whose binaries are linked against glibc, and
      Firefox, as NodeJS has a strict runtime dependency of GCC.
      <h4>Compiler</h4>
      As you may have guessed, this system's default compiler infrastructure is
      provided by <a href="https://llvm.org">LLVM</a>. Clang and its
      counterparts have become much more widely used and are compatible with
      just about all code I encounter on this machine. Some advantages of this
      are of course the reduced system overhead of not depending on GNU's
      compiler collection, slightly faster compilation times and reduced memory
      usage, and potentially overall safer binaries.
      <h4>Profile</h4>
      Subsequently, this system uses a somewhat custom Portage profile, or at
      least a combination of existing ones. A <code>musl/llvm</code> profile
      exists, but I also wanted to omit multilib support from this system, as I
      do not need to run or build any 32-bit applications. With the way that
      <a
        href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Profile_(Portage)#Combining_profiles"
        target="_blank"
        >cascading profiles</a
      >
      work in Portage, this was quite easy to combine with the
      <code>no-multilib</code> profile. For reference, some primary features
      (USE flags) used on this system are Wayland, Pipewire, elogind, and
      OpenRC. Since no-multilib already has very few things enabled, not many
      things need to be explicitly disabled. Although, I have quite a few
      package-specific USE flags disabling unneeded features to help remove
      dependencies that may only be required for one or two packages.

          the <code>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</code> variable needs to be manually set in

          add the following as well.

      Another QOL modification for me was disabling the rather obnoxious startup
      sound present on all Macbooks. To do this, kernel must be built with
      efivarfs support (<code>CONFIG_EFIVAR_FS</code>) and the partition must be
      mounted at <code>/sys/firmware/efi/efivars/</code>. Next, the following
      commands must be run as proper root, not just with elevated permissions.
      Begin by removing the immutable flag from the appropriate file. Mac's EFI
      terminal uses the bell code (<code>0x07</code>) to audibly play system
      messages/warnings. It can be set to null character to silence it. Lastly,
      replace the immutable flag.
