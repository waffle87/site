    <h2>Synacor Challenge</h2>
    <p><i>2024-07-25</i></p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      After participating in
      <a href="https://adventofcode.com" target="_blank">Advent of Code</a> for
      a few years now, I have grown a fan of Eric Wastl's puzzles. This is a
      multi-part challenge that involves implementing a virtual machine to
      interpret and run the supplied binary file. You are also given a document
      outlining the
      <a
        href="https://git.pngu.org/synacor_challenge/tree/arch-spec"
        target="_blank"
        >architecture specification</a
      >
      of the machine that can run the binary file. Once completed and the basic
      functionality tests are passed, you're taken through a text-based game as
      the program runs, that is very similar to AoC stories. The goal is to find
      8 codes while completing various puzzles in the program. Before the
      original
      <a href="https://challenge.synacor.com" target="_blank">site</a> was taken
      down, it could be used to validate the codes you found, but since it is no
      longer up, The codes can be manually verified. Thanks to
      <a href="https://github.com/Aneurysm9/vm_challenge" target="_blank"
        >Aneurysm9/vm_challenge</a
      >
      for providing a binary file and matching checksums for the codes. I wrote
      a
      <a
        href="https://git.pngu.org/synacor_challenge/tree/tools/validate.py"
        target="_blank"
        >small script</a
      >
      to validate them from a text file. I chose to implement my solution in C
      with a simple stack data structure, as that seems most fitting for this
      project. My implementation and related tools can be found
      <a href="https://git.pngu.org/synacor_challenge" target="_blank">here</a>.
      The rest of what's on this page is likely to be spoilers of the challenge.

    <h4>Code 1</h4>
    <p>This one is found in plain text in the <code>arch-spec</code> file.</p>
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <div class="code-block">
      == hints ==
      - Start with operations 0, 19, and 21.
      - Here's a code for the challenge website: &ltCODE&gt
    </div>
    <h4>Code 2</h4>
    <p>
      After implementing a basic interpreter that supports the first subset of
      opcodes (<code>out</code>, <code>noop</code>, and <code>halt</code>), this
      one is found in the output of program itself.

      Welcome to the Synacor OSCON 2012 Challenge!
      Please record your progress by putting codes like
      this one into the challenge website: &ltCODE&gt
    </div>
    <p>
      Just for fun, this one can also be spotted early on in the hexdump of the
      binary file:
    </p>

    </div>
    <h4>Code 3</h4>
    <p>
      To retrieve this code, the interpreter must be fully implemented and must
      pass the initial self-tests. If those conditions are met, the third code
      is printed.
    </p>
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <div class="code-block">
      Executing self-test...

      self-test complete, all tests pass
      The self-test completion code is: &ltCODE&gt
    </div>
    <h4>Code 4</h4>
    <p>
      Now, the adventure aspect of the challenge begins. Pay attention to the
      things of interest, and <code>take</code>/<code>use</code> them as needed,
      like the tablet here.
    </p>
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <div class="code-block">
      What do you do?
      take tablet

      Taken.

      What do you do?
      use tablet

      You find yourself writing &ltCODE&gt on the tablet.  Perhaps it's some 
      kind of code?
    </div>
    <h4>Code 5</h4>
    <p>
      This appears to be a maze puzzle after several entries of some cardinal
      directions. I mapped my steps with pen and paper and after not too long, I
      arrive at the next code, but not without getting lost and eaten by
      <a href="https://zork.fandom.com/wiki/Grue" target="_blank">Grue's</a>
      numerous times.
    </p>
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <div class="code-block">
      What do you do?
      east

      Chiseled on the wall of one of the passageways, you see:

          &ltCODE&gt
    </div>
    <h4>Code 6</h4>
    <p>
      The next puzzle is a maths problem. There will be some coins each with a
      numeric value that you can inspect to see. The coins must be arranged in a
      specific order to satisfy the equation on the wall.
    </p>
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <div class="code-block">
      There is a strange monument in the center of the hall with circular slots and unusual symbols.  It reads:

      _ + _ * _^2 + _^3 - _ = 399
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Red coin: 2</li>
      <li>Blue coin: 9</li>
      <li>Shiny coin: 5</li>
      <li>Concave coin: 7</li>
      <li>Corroded coin: 3</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is easy enough to be by hand, but why not make another
      <a
        href="https://git.pngu.org/synacor_challenge/tree/tools/coin.py"
        target="_blank"
        >script</a
      >
      to do it. Looks like <code>9 + 2*5^2 + 7^3 - 3 = 399</code> will do, so
      arrange the coins in order blue, red, shiny, concave, corroded. After
      completing this, a previously locked door opens and our next code is
      revealed.
    </p>
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <div class="code-block">
      What do you do?
      use teleporter

      You activate the teleporter!  As you spiral through time and space, you think you see a pattern in the stars...

          &ltCODE&gt
    </div>
    <h4>Code 7</h4>
    <p>
      This is by far the most clever puzzle in this challenge. There's a strange
      book that contains some information about using the teleporter. Some way
      of logging instructions and register values is crucial for this puzzle. It
      appears we must set the 8th register to a certain value. We can set the
      register to a non-zero value to progress in the program, but it will not
      provide the correct code, thus we need to find the correct value. The
      underlying algorithm is a variation of the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function" target="_blank"
        >Ackermann function</a
      >. The modified function can be found in the
      <a
        href="https://git.pngu.org/synacor_challenge/tree/tools/ackermann.c"
        target="_blank"
        >program</a
      >
      used to find the register value. Python proved to be a too slow to compute
      this. Once set to the correct value (25734 in my case), the seventh code
      is shown.
    </p>
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <div class="code-block">
      You wake up on a sandy beach with a slight headache.  The last thing you remember is activating that teleporter... but now you can't find it anywhere in your pack.  Someone seems to have drawn a message in the sand here:

          &ltCODE&gt

      It begins to rain. The message washes away. You take a deep breath and feel firmly grounded in reality as the effects of the teleportation wear off.
    </div>
    <h4>Code 8</h4>
    <p>
      This puzzle looks to be some sort of arrangement of tiles, each with a
      number of arithmetic operation. By moving from one tile to another, you
      are constructing an expression that must evaluate to the number on the
      door: 30. This is a BFS application to construct the shortest path to the
      door. I made another
      <a
        href="https://git.pngu.org/synacor_challenge/tree/tools/orb_maze.py"
        target="_blank"
        >script</a
      >
      to achieve this. After inputting the appropriate cardinal directions, we
      see the final code in a mirror. Of course, it is entered in reverse.
    </p>
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <div class="code-block">
      You gaze into the mirror, and you see yourself gazing back.
      But wait!
      It looks like someone wrote on your face while you were unconscious on the beach!
      Through the mirror, you see &ltCODE&gt scrawled in charcoal on your forehead.

      Congratulations; you have reached the end of the challenge!
