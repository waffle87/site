    <h2>Gentoo Linux on Macbook Air</h2>
    This page covers various features, nuances, notes, etc. of my
    Gentoo system running on a 2012 Macbook Air. This laptop was
    initially bought as a tinkering project for $150USD. While this
    is not the most powerful device, it is suitable for all the work
    I encounter on a daily basis and is used as my primary system. My
    intentions for this system are reliability and speed most importantly.
    With this comes a tidy OS with quite few kernel parameters set, 
    fine-tuned USE flags, and a usable system that I'm very familiar with.
    All my configuration can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/waffle87/dots/tree/xena" target="_blank">Github</a>.

      <h4>Modifications</h4>
      Since 2010, Apple Macbooks have used their proprietary SSDs
      with non-standard connectors. When I bought this machine, it
      came with a 128 GB Samgsung "blade" SSD which I was not very
      keen on keeping. Luckily, there exists <a href="https://www.microconnectors.com/macbook-m-2-nvme-upgrade-adapter/" target="_blank">adapters</a>
      which simply act as a bridge between a standard M.2 SSD and Apple's
      connector. Installation was quite easy and the adapter has been
      reliable since. This laptop also came with what I presume was the
      original battery, as it lasted about 15 minutes after being charged
      and would lose power randomly. A suitable <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Replacement-Battery-MacBook-7200mAh-Laptop/dp/B07SDBKDDK" target="_blank">replacement</a>
      can be found roughly $50USD. With this, I get about 5 hours on
      a full charge, mostly thanks to <a href="https://github.com/linrunner/TLP" target="_blank">TLP</a>
      and thermald. Now, if only the memory wasn't soldered directly to
      the motherboard, or I could find the courage to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aH4n9xBaWxg" target="_blank">replace it</a>.
    </div>
    <div id="kernel">
      <h3>Kernel</h3>
      After spending many hours narrowing down kernel options enabled,
      I have a 7.8 MB kernel image with ~4000 parameters set. Note,
      this configuration is very hardware and user specific. I opted
      for absolutely zero modules since I don't need any out-of-tree
      hardware support. I also did not configure anything very drastically
      in either direction, like extreme security, sacraficing usability, etc.
      I chose to use <a href="https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-kernel/gentoo-sources" target="_blank">gentoo-sources</a>
      to provide kernel source as it contains some handy patches and is easy
      to obtain via emerge. A base 6.7 kernel builds locally (remember, 4 
      cores) in approximately 17 minutes, which is not too much of a pain
      when troubleshooting on bare metal. I also chose to omit an initramfs,
      which means CPU microcode can/should be built directly into the kernel.
      This can be achieved by first installing <code>sys-firmware/intel-microcode</code>.
      This is also a good time to add microcode signature to <code>/etc/portage/make.conf</code>
      <pre>
$ iucode_tool -S -l /lib/firmware/intel-ucode/*
iucode_tool: system has processor(s) with signature 0x000306a9
microcode bundle 1: /lib/firmware/intel-ucode/06-3a-09
selected microcodes:
  001/001: sig 0x000306a9, pf_mask 0x12, 2019-02-13, rev 0x0021, size 14336
# echo 'MICROCODE_SIGNATURES="-s 0x000306a9"' >> /etc/portage/make.conf
      </pre>
      CPU's signature is found in bundle 1, so the filename to use is <code>/lib/firmware/intel-ucode/06-3a-09</code>.
      Ensure the following kernel options are set approximately, where the argument
      passed to <code>CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE</code> is the filename of our microcode
      <pre>
CONFIG_MICROCODE=y
CONFIG_FW_LOADER=y
CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE="intel-ucode/06-3a-09"
CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE_DIR="/lib/firmware"
      </pre>
      Check dmesg for microcode output to ensure all was successful.
      My specific configuation for this machine can be found at
      <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waffle87/dots/xena/.config/kernel.config">6.7.4 .config</a>

      For
      some more kernel related stuff, see <a href="kernel.html">here</a>.
    </div>
    <div id="bootloader">
      <h3>Bootloader</h3>
      Spoiler: there is none. For the duration of my time using Linux, I have used GRUB as my
      bootloader across various systems. In my experience, it's been
      ok, it does what it needs to, allows for extensive configuration
      like theming and requiring a password. However, some time ago it
      went kaput and despite manually setting the root partition in
      <code>/boot/grub/grub.cfg</code>, it seems the incorrect value
      was passed to the kernel at boot and the partition could not be found.
      Every time I would reboot I would have to manually set it (which
      is a handy trick to know nonetheless)
      <pre>
grub> ls
(hd0) (hd0,gpt0) (hd0,gpt1) (hd0,gpt2)
grub> ls (hd0,gpt1)/
vmlinuz vmlinuz.old
grub> root=(hd0,gpt1)
grub> linux /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/sda3
grub> boot
      </pre>
      Since this isn't a multiboot machine or anything, I can simply omit
      GRUB and expose the kernel image as an EFI stub. First, the
      following kernel options must be set
      <pre>
CONFIG_EFI=y
CONFIG_EFI_STUB=y
CONFIG_CMDLINE_BOOL=y
CONFIG_CMDLINE="root=PARTUUID=... ro"
      </pre>
      The root must be set to the <code>PARTUUID</code> value
      of the root partition. Use <code>blkid</code> to obtain this
      Once kernel has been recompiled, copy the image to the EFI partition
      and create a new boot entry. It is also wise to remove unneeded entries
      to conserve space
      <pre>
# efibootmgr -b 1 -B
# cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage /boot/efi/gentoo/bzImage-x.y.z.efi
# efibootmgr -c -d /dev/sda -L "gentoo efi stub" -l "\efi\gentoo\bzImage-x.y.z.efi"
      </pre>
      Reboot and the bootable system should be shown in Mac's EFI program
    </div>
    <div id="portage">
      <h3>Portage</h3>
      <h4>Profile</h4>
      When initially setting this up, I opted for a multilib system as
      I was still using some 32-bit programs at the time. Since, I have
      switched to a no-multilib profile. Unlike adding multilib support
      to a 64-bit only system, going from multilib to no-multilib is
      quite easy.
      <pre>
# eselect profile list
  ...
  [12]  default/linux/amd64/17.1/no-multilib (stable)
  ...
# eselect profile set 12
# emerge -auDN @world
# emerge --depclean
      </pre>
      It was pleasant to see 60+ packages removed after the switch. And
      have much reduced overhead in my system overall.
      <h4>Compiler</h4>
      As Clang/LLVM has become more and more stable and is able to compile all
      packages installed, I chose to switch the default compiler, linker
      and other bits over from GCC. This is easy enough in <code>/etc/portage/make.conf</code>.
      <pre>
CC="clang"
CXX="clang++"
AR="llvm-ar"
NM="llvm-nm"
RANLIB="llvm-ranlib"
      </pre>
      If needed, a GCC fallback environment can be made containing the
      previous variables, then applied to certain packages which may fail
      under Clang via adding an entry in <code>/etc/portage/package.env</code>.
      Some advantagees of using Clang over GCC are slightly faster compilation
      times and reduced memory usage, and potentially safer binaries overall.
      <h4>USE Flags</h4>
      My USE flags and related options are quite minimal. Global flags include
      <pre>
USE="alsa bluetooth clang dbus elogind gles2 jpeg png \
     pulseaudio sdl udev wayland X -systemd -vulkan -nls"
ACCEPT_LICENSE="*"
ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~amd64"
      </pre>
      For reference, some primary features used on this system are
      Wayland, Pipewire, elogind, and OpenRC. Since no-multilib already
      has very few things enabled, not many flags needed to be disabled.

            To omit the need for a display manager and launch directly
            from a tty, the <code>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</code> variable needs
            to be manually set in shell startup file (<code>~/.zshrc</code>)
            Then to launch Sway, simply add the following as well.
            <pre>
if test -z "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"; then
    export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/${UID}-runtime-dir
    if ! test -d "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"; then
        mkdir "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"
        chmod 0700 "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"

          <b>Keyboard Manager: </b><a href="https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd" target="_blank">Keyd</a><br>
            For many months, I used <a href="https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad" target="_blank">KMonad</a>,
            which was suitable for most of what I needed, but lacked a couple
            things, namely key combos. I stumbled across Keyd which to my
            surprise did in fact support combos. The <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waffle87/dots/xena/.config/keyd.conf" target="_blank">configuration syntax</a>
            is also incredibly simple. After creating an OpenRC service
            script, it was ready for use. Putting this here as I'm sure
            I'll need to reference it sometime in the future.

                <a href="https://github.com/starship/starship" target="_blank">starship prompt</a>
                which provides some useful UI tools like Git repository status.

                <a href="https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide" target="_blank">zoxide cd replacement</a>
                which has auto-jump functionality meaning <code>cd very/long/long/path</code>
                can be simplified to <code>cd path</code>.

              <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/eza-community/eza" target="_blank">eza ls replacement</a>
                which mostly offers useful UI improvments like file

                <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat" target="_blank">bat cat replacement</a>
                also mostly consists of UI features like syntax
                highlighting and line numbers.

          roughly 150,000 lines of code, while doas only contains about
          4,000. For a personal computer like this, doas is more than
          capable of achieving what I need it to. By default, the "persist"

      <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
      Another QOL modification for me was disabling the rather obnoxious
      startup sound present on all Macbooks. To do this, kernel must be
      built with efivarfs support (<code>CONFIG_EFIVAR_FS</code>) and the
      partition must be mounted at <code>/sys/firmware/efi/efivars/</code>.
      Next, the following commands must be run as proper root, not just
      with elevated permissions. Begin by removing the immutable flag from
      the appropriate file. Mac's EFI terminal uses the bell code (<code>0x07</code>)
      to audibly play system messages/warnings. It can be set to null character
      to silence it. Lastly, replace the immutable flag.
